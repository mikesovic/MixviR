Description: Explore, characterize, and visualize DNA and amino acid variation from short-read DNA sequence samples from a target group that potentially contain mixtures of variants/lineages. Originally created to help analyze environmental SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) samples from environmental sources such as wastewater or dust, but can be applied to any microbial group.
